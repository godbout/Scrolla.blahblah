# THE SITE

best marketing site for any of my apps so far: [Scrolla.app](https://scrolla.app)

# WHY SCROLLA

i'm lazy af. can't be bothered moving the hands away from the keyboard.

# THE LICENSE

no license. Scrolla is free. it's not open-source because it's sharing private packages with [kindaVim](https://github.com/godbout/kindaVim.docs) and [Wooshy](https://github.com/godbout/Wooshy.docs). but maybe one day. but most probably never. (not true tho as a system has been put in place to release Scrolla open source in case of death.)

# THE DOCS

THE DOCS are now at https://docs.scrolla.app. still looking a bit funky sorry.

# THE ROADMAP

* custom key mapping
* stop stealing focus from current window

# THE ALTERNATIVES

* [Vimac](https://github.com/dexterleng/vimac) (open source, free)
* [Keyboard Scroller](https://github.com/dexterleng/KeyboardScroller.docs) (closed source, free)
* [Homerow](https://www.homerow.app) (closed source, one time purchase)
